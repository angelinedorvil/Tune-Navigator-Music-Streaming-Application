# Tune-Navigator-Music-Streaming-Application

Created a music streaming application using a modified doubly linked list as the data structure for a playlist. 
Allowed users to navigate through a playlist (display the next, previous, first, or last song) and select a song to "play". 
Implemented commands for playlist navigation and song selection using Python.
